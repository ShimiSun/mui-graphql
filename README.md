A sample application to demonstrate the exploration of new frameworks and tools while maintaining a mobile-first and accessible-inclusive UI according to WCAG 2.0 AA.
ScubaHub demonstrates in a fun & hip way building an end-to-end application with the following:

- Next.JS - Application framework for React
- Contentful - GraphQL Content API
- GraphQL - queries
- Apollo Client - query digest
- Material UI - UI library
- Emotion - Isolated component styling
- Cypress - Integration tests
- Google Maps API - Integration example (without a developer APIKey)
- Netlify - website deployment
